        <div class="img3"><img src="images/snivyEvoLine.jpg" alt="snivyevo"></div>
        <p class="p">It is very intelligent and calm, using their vines more adeptly than its hands. They
            photosynthesize by bathing their tails in sunlight, which increases its movement speed. When they are not
            feeling well, their tails droop. - Flavor Text/Pokedex Description</p>

        <div class="img3"><img src="images/oshawottEvoLine.jpg" alt="img3"></div>
        <p class="p">It wields the scalchop on its stomach like a knife, blocking the moves of its enemies before
            slashing back at them in swift retaliation. It's said that Oshawott learned to maintain its scalchop with
            riverbed stones by mimicking humans it saw using whetstones.</p>

        <p class="p">It's more nimble than it looks, and it uses its speed to confound its enemies. It rapidly launches
            fireballs from both nostrils. This Pokémon is a ravenous glutton. It uses its excellent sense of smell to
            find food, then cooks it to a crisp before eating.</p>
